** Sheet.js
This is a google app script. Used to integrate between a google sheet and calendar.
The "L" column of the sheet takes a date as the input and "B", "C" column takes a string.
The script creates a menu button on google sheets to run the function **'hsFollowup'** and creates an all day event in the google calendar with the date in "L" column.
